Onshape
---

Onshape is a computer-aided design (CAD) software system, delivered over the Internet via a Software as a Service (SAAS) model.

Onshape makes extensive use of cloud computing. 

Onshape allows teams to collaborate on a single shared design, the same way multiple writers can work together editing a shared document via cloud services. 

Onshape upgrades are released directly to the web interface, and the software does not require maintenance work from the user.

Inventor
---

Autodesk Inventor is a computer-aided design application for 3D mechanical design, simulation, visualization, and documentation developed.

Inventor allows 2D and 3D data integration in a single environment, creating a virtual representation of the final product that enables users to validate the form, fit, and function of the product before it is ever built. Autodesk Inventor includes powerful parametric, direct edit and freeform modeling tools as well as multi-CAD translation capabilities and in their standard DWG™ drawings.

V-rep
---

V-rep provides a unified framework combining many powerful internal and external libraries that are often useful for robotics simulations. This includes dynamic simulation engines, forward/inverse kinematics tools, collision detection libraries, vision sensor simulations, path planning, GUI development tools, and built-in models of many common robots.
