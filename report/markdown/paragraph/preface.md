Design Motivation
---

After grouping,among the eight subjects given by the teacher,we discussed and studied each subject. Finally, we selected the topic of the marble machine system. Because the marble machine system is the suitable for our ability, we decided to design the system by ourselves. After the research in many aspect, decided to build a playground for the marble machine system, and watch the bo~bo~ always rolling. It's soothing that make everyone calm.

Design Purpose
---

The purpose of this topic is to skillfully use Onshape to draw components and V-rep simulations, promote our own strength and apply the system to the future practical applications. For the reason, we search for the related videos on the web and refer to the topic of the senior sister. However, we refer to most of the data to be single. It makes us want to make more mechanism to coordinate with each other and design our own marble machine system.
